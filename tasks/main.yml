# tasks file for ius-repo
# On CentOS, epel-release is available in the default repositories. Therefore,
# ius-release can just resolve the dependency automatically. On RHEL (or other
# RHEL clones) you will need to explicitly install epel-release first. This
# task can be moved to it's own play if you want to be able to require it
# independently of the IUS state declaration.
